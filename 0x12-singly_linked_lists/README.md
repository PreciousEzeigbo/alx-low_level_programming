In this project, I practiced building and using singly linked lists in C

1. List length - C function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
2. Add node - C function that adds a new node at the beginning a of a list_t list.
3. Add node at the end - C function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list_t list.
4. Free list - C function that frees a list_t list.
5. The Hare and the Tortoise - 100-first.c: a C function that prints "You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\n bore my house uponn my back!\n efore main function is executed".
6. 101-hello_school.asm: 64-bit assembly program that prints "Hello, School" followed by a new line using only the printf functiion without interrupts.
